        <p>
            The World Wide Web (abbreviated as WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as http://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext
            links, and are accessible over the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland. The browser was released outside of CERN in
            1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.
